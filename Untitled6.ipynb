      "The living world comprises an amazing diversity of living organisms. Early man deified some of the inanimate matter (wind, sea, fire etc.) The description of living organisms including human beings began much later in human history. Societies which indulged in anthropocentric view of biology could register limited progress in biological knowledge. Systematic and monumental description of life forms brought in, out of necessity, detailed systems of identification, nomenclature and classification. The biggest spin off of such studies was the recognition of the sharing of similarities among living organisms both horizontally and vertically. In the following chapters of this unit, you will get a description, including classification, of animals and plants from a taxonomist’s perspective. The extraordinary habitats in which we find living organisms, be it cold mountains, deciduous forests, oceans, fresh water lakes, deserts or hot springs, leave us speechless. As scientists, we shall not attempt answering the second question. In plants, this growth by cell division occurs continuously throughout their life span. In majority of higher animals and plants, growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events. Non-living objects also grow if we take increase in body mass as a criterion for growth. Growth, therefore, cannot be taken as a defining property of living organisms. Conditions under which it can be observed in all living organisms have to be explained and then we understand that it is a characteristic of living systems. The fungi, the filamentous algae, the protonema of mosses, all easily multiply by fragmentation. When it comes to unicellular organisms like bacteria, unicellular algae or Amoeba, reproduction is synonymous with growth, i.e., increase in number of cells. Hence, reproduction also cannot be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms. Of course, no non-living object is capable of reproducing or replicating by itself. There are thousands of metabolic reactions occurring simultaneously inside all living organisms, be they unicellular or multicellular. The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in our body is metabolism. Metabolic reactions can be demonstrated outside the body in cell-free systems. Photoperiod affects reproduction in seasonal breeders, both plants and animals. Consciousness therefore, becomes the defining property of living organisms. In higher classes, you will come to know that all living phenomena are due to underlying interactions. These interactions result in emergent properties at a higher level of organisation. Biology is the story of evolution of living organisms on earth.\n"
